# üëã Hi, I'm Franco!  
üë®‚Äçüíª Hello there! I'm Franco Mi√±o, an enthusiastic Full Stack Developer, although I specialize mainly in backend development. I received my training as a Full Stack Web Developer at Henry in February 2022. üíªü§ì

üè¢ During my time at the startup Henry SA, I had the opportunity to be part of the team that initiated the development of a robust examination system. We implemented a bi-weekly exam schedule using agile methodologies and unit testing to ensure continuous improvement and reliability. While I didn't lead the team, my colleagues and I were able to bring continuous improvements to the system. Additionally, I contributed to optimizing evaluation processes for students during their lab stages.


üìö I have a strong background in software development, with a specialized focus on backend and a solid understanding of frontend. I'm passionate about crafting efficient and scalable solutions in the backend, while also having a keen interest in frontend development. My goal is to continue honing my skills as a backend developer while remaining adaptable to frontend challenges. I have acquired a robust understanding of design patterns and software architecture, applying these principles to create reliable and scalable solutions. While my primary focus lies in backend development, where I can deliver comprehensive and effective solutions, I also have experience in frontend, particularly with React and Next, enabling me to make significant contributions in that domain when needed.

üí° My main goal is to continue growing as a professional, gaining more experience and knowledge in both backend and frontend development.
